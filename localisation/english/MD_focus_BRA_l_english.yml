 brazil_flavour_events.9.d: "The Banco Central was robbed today in Fortaleza. Banco Central works much akin to the Federal Reserve in the United States and controls the circulation of the money supply. The burglary was a culmination of months of effort and time spent by the masterminds. A local landscaping company was set up in a property the gang renovated in order to mask the operation occurring beneath the city streets. The gang burrowed 78m (~256ft) underneath nearly two city blocks to a position properly underneath the bank.  When their plan came to fruition they burrowed through 1.1m (~3.6 ft) of steel-reinforced concrete to enter the bank vault. The resulting loss was R$164,755,150 (~$71.6 million USD) of bills that were not numbered sequentially making the lost funds nearly impossible to trace."

 brazil.21.d: "President Bolsonaro has this week appointed his second judge to the Supreme Court, Judge Andre Mendonca. Finally fulfilling Bolsonaro's campaign promises and satisfying much of the religious majjority that helped him get elected. This makes Judge Mendonca another conservative pick for the insitution with two more judges to be appointed. However, this event has stirred up some controversy in relation to Brazil's stated secularity of government as Judge Mendonca has stated in the past that he views the process of conversion back to religion inevitable and has exercised his view that the government should give more power to religious insitutions."
