 GER_automotive_investments_in_europe: "유럽 자동차 투자"
 GER_automotive_investments_in_europe_desc: "다른 유럽국들의 시장에 공격적으로 투자를 진행하면서, 독일 자동차 생산업은 독일 산업계를 떠나면서 과감하게 인건비를 줄였습니다. EU 회원국의 인건비가 독일의 인건비보다 낮은 것이었기 때문에 벌어진 현상이었습니다. 메르세데스-벤츠는 헝가리의 케치케메트를, 폴크스바겐은 슬로바키아의 브라티슬라바에서의 공장을 짓기위해 더 많은 투자자를 찾고 있습니다."
 GER_strengthen_volkswagen: "폴크스바겐 투자"
 GER_strengthen_volkswagen_desc: "독일 재정부 장관은 니더작센의 30% 일자리가 독일에서 가장 큰 기업이자 해외에 소프트 파워를 과시하는 독일의 주요한 협력사인 폴크스바겐에 의존하고 있는 것을 파악했습니다. 독일 경제의 몇몇 확률은 이 회사가 큰 영향력을 과시하고 있습니다. 그 규모를 보나 절대 실패할리가 없습니다."

 GER_the_kaluga_plant_desc: "러시아의 수도 모스크바의 남동쪽 150km와 오카 강에 위치한 칼루가는 폴스크바겐사의 VW 또는 아우디 모델의 잠재적인 생산지에 딱 맞는 것으로 파악되었습니다. 이 칼루가 공장은 독일의 산업구획에서 일하는 근로자보다 적은 임금으로 5,000명의 러시아인을 고용할 것입니다."
 GER_the_aurangabad_plant: "아우랑가바드 공장"
 GER_the_aurangabad_plant_desc: "폴크스바겐에게 있어서 인도는 크고 전혀 손길이 닿지 않은 시장입니다. 반면에, 독일차는 이미 중국 시장을 타격하여 충격을 주었지만, 전 세계에서 2위의 인구를 자랑하는 인도에는 더 많은 마케팅과 시간이 필요해 보입니다. 독일의 회사가 빠르게 행동하지 않는다면, 인도인들은 성장하여 스스로 자동차를 만들어 시장을 공략해버릴 것입니다."
 GER_expand_volkswagen_into_china: "폴크스바겐 중국 투자"
 GER_expand_volkswagen_into_china_desc: "중국인들은 이미 폴크스바겐 자동차를 사고 있는 반면에, 더 많은 이들이 회사를 설립하여서 자국의 노동자들을 고용하고 있습니다. 중국 정부가 폴크스바겐의 투자와 일자리 창출에 의존하게 된다면, 중국에서의 독일 시장 영향력은 엄청난 증가세를 보일 것입니다. 상하이와 랴오닝의 계획된 도시에 수만명에서 수천명의 노동자를 고용할 수 있을 것입니다."

 GER_dresden_and_leipzig_factories_desc: "폴크스바겐 해외 일자리를 통해서 이익을 창출하고 있지만, 자국 내 노동자들이 행복하다는 것은 아닙니다. 오래된 중공업 단지가 위치한 작센에서 폴크스바겐은 새로운 최신 공장 설립을 계획했습니다. 하지만 이익을 창출하기 위해서는 정부보조금과 세금 절세 허가가 필요할 것입니다."

 GER_utilize_spd_influence_in_lower_saxony_desc: "역사적으로 SPD(사회 민주당)은 더 강성한 기민/기사연합 (CDU/CSU)의 아래로 항상 2등을 차지했습니다. 1998년 게르하르트 슈뢰더가 4년 임기로 재임자 헬무트 콜의 자리를 이어받았습니다. 슈뢰더의 권력은 고향인 니더작센주에 있습니다. 이곳은 SPD(사회 민주당)를 매우 지지하고 있으며, 독일의 가장 큰 대기업인 폴크스바겐의 본사가 있는 곳으로 슈뢰더의 든든한 정치적 동맹이 되어주고 있습니다."

 GER_coal_industry_compromise_desc: "SPD(사회 민주당)와 녹색당이  연합 자유의사결정당과 FDP(자유민주당)에 맞서서 연합하였지만, 1999년 오스카어 라퐁텐의 추락과 슈로더의 클린텅 추종주의는 SPD(사회 민주당)와 녹색당 사이에 불협화음이 생기게 만들었습니다. 반면에 피셔는 화석 연료 사용을 금지하는 방안을 추구하고 있으며, SPD(사회 민주당)는 산업 노동자들의 지지를 계속해서 받기를 원하고 있습니다. 언제나 그렇듯 다투는 주요 의제는 석탄입니다."
 GER_foreign_policy_pragmatism: "외교정책 실용주의"
 GER_foreign_policy_pragmatism_desc: "슈뢰더 정권은 첫 임기 2년간은 몇몇 실용주의 정책을 관저에서 펼쳤습니다. 독일이 UN 안전보장 이사회에 독일이 계속 자리잡을려는 것을 지지하는 독일 수상의 지지가 유럽 연방주의의 추구 지지와 함께 독일의 유럽 최우동맹국인 프랑스와의 사이를 소원하게 했습니다. SPD(사회 민주당)와 녹색당은 자신들의 정책의 잘못을 깨달을 필요가 있습니다."
 GER_limited_haushaltskonsolidierung: "제한된 예산 통합"
 GER_limited_haushaltskonsolidierung_desc: "슈뢰더의 행정부의 초기 목표중 하나는 Haushaltskonsolidierung(예산 통합)으로 실행하지는 못했습니다. 사회 민주당 지도자의 지시아래 예산의 증가하였고 개인의 빚 또한 가구당, 1인당 계속해서 증가하였습니다. 이로 인한 혼란을 최소화하기 위해서 독일은 모든 분야, 국방비같은 곳의 예산을 제한할 수 있습니다."
 GER_green_card_initiative: "취업 허가증 계획(Green Card Initiative)"
 GER_green_card_initiative_desc: "미국과 캐나다 이민 프로그램에 감명을 받아서, 슈뢰더 정부는 '취업 허가증 계획(Green Card Initiative)'를 도입하여 외국 IT 종사자들이 독일의 낙후된 고기술 분야에서 사력을 다할 수 있도록 했습니다. 슈뢰더 정권 이전의 콜 정권에서는 인터넷과 IT 개발을 방치하였습니다. 방향을 새로 잡을 필요가 있습니다."
 GER_pension_reform: "연금 계획"
 GER_pension_reform_desc: "보수당에 대항해서 사회 민주당이 내세우고 있는 것은 연금 규모로, 이는 1998년 슈뢰더와 콜의 대선경쟁에서도 별다른 차이가 없는 것입니다. 슈뢰더 정권이 독일 노년층을 충분히 만족시키지 못한다면, 노동자 사이의 SPD(사회 민주당)의 지지율은 급감할 것입니다."
 GER_digitalized_education_system: "교육 시스템 디지털화"
 GER_digitalized_education_system_desc: "1998년 대선당시 슈뢰더의 주요 공약으로는 '웹상의 학교(Schulen ans Netz)'로 콜 집권 당시에도 낮은 초등학교 및 고등학교의 인터넷 접근성과 연관지어 내걸었습니다. '웹상의 학교(Schulen ans Netz)'는 엄청난 비용이 들겠지만, 독일 학생들에게 있어 엄청난 도움이 될 것입니다."

 GER_improved_federal_education_standards_desc: "독일에서 '교육 우선주의(Bildungshoheit der Länder)는 교육제도에 연방이 간섭하기 보다는 개인이 자신의 목표를 가지고 능동적으로 교육을 하도록 하였습니다. 노르트라인 베스트팔렌, 브레멘과 같은 주에서 불리하게 작용하는 이 정책은 바이에른에서는 완전히 신용을 잃었습니다. 연방교육제도로 수정될 필요가 있습니다."
 GER_international_business: "국제 사업"
 GER_international_business_desc: "독일은 종종 스스로를 '수출 분야에서는 세계 챔피언(Exportweltmeister)'이라고 자랑스러워합니다. 독일 경제는 아주 오래전부터 막대한 무역 흑자를 보고 있었습니다. 수출 친화적인 정책은 수많은 외국 정치적 실용주의를 필요로 합니다. 무엇보다도 독재자가 가진 돈과 지지받는 지도자가 가진 돈은 어쨌든 좋은 상황임에 틀림없습니다."

 GER_oil_trade_negotiations: "원유 무역 협정"
 GER_oil_trade_negotiations_desc: "독일의 원유 공급량은 국가에서 가장 중요하면서도 현존하는 비상사태입니다. 독일의 원유 수입국은 다양합니다. 노르웨이, 나과라이, 리비아, 아라크, 카자하스탄, 스코트랜드. 독일은 온 대륙을 돌아다니며 귀중한 자원을 무역을 통해 얻을 것입니다."
 GER_nord_stream: "노르드 스트림"
 GER_nord_stream_desc: "슈뢰더는 러시아의 독재자 블라디미르 푸틴과 노골적으로 친분이 있습니다. 러시아-독일 무역은 러시아의 천연 자원과 독일의 수요에 의해 논의되고 있는 상황입니다. 러시아 가스 채굴 대기업 가즈프롬은 우크라이나와 폴란드를 경유하여 발트해 국가들에 연결된 파이프라인에서 직통으로 독일이 가스를 받을 수 있도록 하는 계획을 가지고 있습니다. 이것이 바로 '노르드 스트림'입니다. 이 계획은 독일에 크나큰 이윤을 안겨주지만, 동유럽 국가들은 불편을 나타낼 것입니다."
 GER_appease_eastern_europe: "동유럽에 대한 유화정책"
 GER_appease_eastern_europe_desc: "노르드 스트림에 대한 자국의 투자는 폴란드, 슬로바키아, 체코, 우크라이나에게 있어서 무역 부분, 독일과 서유럽에 원유를 전달하는 이윤에 크나큰 타격을 줄 것입니다. 지금은 조심해서 파이프라인 무역을 실시하여 동맹국과의 관계를 친밀하게 유지시켜 나가야 합니다. 러시아는 언제나 금수조치를 할 수 있기에 믿을만한 상대가 아닙니다."

 GER_the_internet_neuland: "'미개척지(neuland)' 인터넷"
 GER_the_internet_neuland_desc: "2013년 6월 19일 유명한 연설이 행해졌습니다. 앙겔라 메르켈 총리는 인터넷은 '모두에게 주어진 미개척지'라고 설명을 하였지만, 독일인의 95%이상이 인터넷에 접속하며, 절반 이상이 주기적으로 인터넷에 접속합니다. 메르켈의 발언은 인터넷 정책의 실수로 보수당에게 그 책임이 있었습니다. 참고로 말하자면 독일 인터넷의 느린 속도는 콜 수상의 탓이었습니다."

 GER_agenda_2010_desc: "게르하르트 슈뢰더는 언제나 사회 민주당에서 중도의 입장을 고수했으나 예산의 제한에는 열렬한 지지를 표했습니다. '2010 의제'는 예산을 제한하고 심각한 빚으로 좌파 인사들에게 받는 비판을 아예 없애기 위해 관료 개혁을 행하여 정부 주도의 국가를 꿈꾸는 계획이었습니다. 하지만 경제 상황으로 볼 때 이는 판타지소설에 불과했습니다."

 GER_sonderparteitag: "특별 정당 회의(Sonderparteitag)"
 GER_sonderparteitag_desc: "라풍텐의 사퇴이후, 슈뢰더의 독일내 좌파 세력에 대한 지지가 약해지게 되었습니다. 노동 조합과 법인 소속의 고용주와 고용인들의 이익을 최대한으로 조정하면서 최소한도를 정하기 위한다는 명목으로 사무직들과 노동자들의 다툼은 점점 깊어져 갔습니다. 더욱 더 심해지기 전에 게르하르트 슈뢰더는 연방 의장으로써 정당 대표를 선출하는데 모든 역량을 다해야만 합니다."

 germany.34.d: "Hofer is a German businessman who sold car parts to various contacts in Iran. As he visited Teheran in 1997 for the third time, he got arrested for illicit sex with a medical student. He indeed meets her in a hotel foyer, gave her his business card and offered her a free stay in Hamburg if she wants to come there. He told the judges that they didn't even kiss, but the sentence was death by stoning in the end, as the media in Iran demanded it. German lawyers could later revert the sentence to imprisonment.\n\nA year later the court resumes the trial against Hofer, again for illicit sex with a Muslim, but now also for espionage and insulting Iranian officials. Again with the help from his lawyers and German officials the charges got dropped and his imprisonment lifted.\n\nBefore the Iranian government could summon him back to court for another trial, the German ambassador organized a flight back to Germany where he arrived today. It seems the 3 year-long hell trip ended for Helmut Hofer."

 Germany.369.d: "이번 독일 리워크에서는, 다수의 새로운 시스템이 도입되었습니다. 대표적으로, 독일 연방헌법수호청 시스템 (화면 오른쪽 중앙 차트 위 아이콘), 바이에른 민족주의 디시전, 동독과 서독의 분열 디시전 등이 있습니다. 디시전들은 쉽게 이해할 수 있지만, 연방헌법수호청 시스템의 경우 새로운 형태이기에 처음에는 플레이 하는데 혼란이 생길 수 있습니다.\n그럼 어떻게 진행하는 걸까요?\n\n 일단 독일 연방헌법수호청 아이콘을 화면 오른쪽 아래의 '차트' 아이콘 위에서 찾을 수 있으며, 기본적으로 이 시스템은 극단주의 정당을 플레이 하거나 반대로 금지하고 싶을 때 활용할 수 있습니다. 쉽게 얘기하면, §B극단주의 집단을 통제 및 관리할 수 있는 3개의 부서가 원활히 돌아갈 수 있도록 충분한 예산을 편성하고 유지하는 것§!이 이 시스템의 목적입니다. 3개의 부서에 높은 수준의 예산이 편성된다면 국가의 민주주의에 아무런 문제가 발생할 수 없을 것입니다. 중간 규모의 예산이 편성된다면, 부서들은 현재 수준의 상태를 유지할 것입니다. 그러나 매우 낮은 수준의 예산이 편성된다면, 각 부서의 상태가 약화되기 시작하며 심할 경우 부서가 공준 분해 될 수 있고, 이에 개입하지 않는다면 국가의 내전이 발생할 수 있습니다. 구체적으로 제 2 부서와 5 부서가 붕괴되면, 내전이 곧바로 시작될 것입니다. 만약 제 6 부서가 무너진다면, 이 이후에는 다른 결과가 기다리고 있을 겁니다. 그러나 한번 내전이 발발하면, 당신이 내전에서 승리할 경우 3개의 극단주의 정당 중 하나의 이념으로 이후 계속해서 플레이 할 수 있습니다.\n\n아무쪼록 새로운 독일을 재미있게 즐겨주시길 바랍니다,\n - Millennium Dawn 독일 리워크 팀 올림."
