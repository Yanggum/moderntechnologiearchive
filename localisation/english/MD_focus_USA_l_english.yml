 donald_trump.8.t: "소행성 채굴 계획 시작"
 donald_trump.8.d: "Asteroid Mining has been a fantasy for many before us. Asteroids themselves carry much wanted platinum group metals, gold, silver, and iron group metals. It could become extremely lucrative for any spacefaring country. So today, the establishment of an Asteroid Mining Initiative, or AMI, will provide the first step towards mining asteroids. Using vast telescope arrays across the United States, we can look for suitable asteroids in nearby outer space, then pull it into orbit and mine it. Spotting a suitable asteroid will be difficult, as, relative to the distance they are at, they are quite small. Luckily, there's actually quite a few which pass by Earth every so often, so it wouldn't take long to get one to stay in Earth's orbit."

 donald_trump.9.t: "소행성 발견"
 donald_trump.9.d: "최근, 나사의 과학자들은 지구 근처를 지나가는 적당한 소행성을 발견했습니다. 일부 사람들은 우리가 실제로 적합하고 경제적인 소행성을 발견할 수 있을지 의심했기 때문에, 이것은 AMI에게 안도감을 주었습니다. 하지만 이 소행성은 충분히 느리게 움직이고 있고, 충분히 크며, 궤도로 이동하여 채굴할 수 있을 만큼 풍부합니다. 사실 이 소행성은 뉴욕 주보다 큽니다. 다음 단계는 단순히 이 소행성을 지구 주위의 궤도로 옮기는 것인데, 이것은 이전에 해본 적이 없는 것입니다. 그 동안, NASA 엔지니어들이, 스페이스X와 같은 민간 기업들도, 소행성을 채굴하는 메커니즘을 발명하여 소행성이 궤도에 진입할 때까지 준비할 것입니다."

 donald_trump.10.d: "이 소행성이 궤도에 오르면서, 나사와 스페이스X는 둘 다 궤도를 도는 소행성에 임무를 보내고 있다. 나사는 주로 과학적 데이터 수집에 관심이 있는 반면, 스페이스X는 그 물질을 채굴하는 데 더 관심이 있습니다. 의심할 여지 없이 이것은 우주에서 우리에게 우위를 주는 주목할 만한 업적입니다. 심지어 더 많은 소행성을 가져오는 것에 대한 이야기도 있지만, 이 소행성이 매우 크고 채광에 적합하기 때문에 나중에 소행성을 추가할 수 있다고 많은 사람들이 말합니다. 다른 나라들은 이미 우리를 부러워하며 그들만의 소행성 채굴 프로그램을 고려하고 있습니다. 거기에 도달하기 위한 기술을 개발하는 것조차 비용이 극도로 높기 때문에 스페이스X나 나사 사이에 경쟁이 일어날 것이라는 걱정은 거의 없습니다."

 donald_trump.12.o1: "훌륭하군!"
 donald_trump.13.t: "소행성 채굴의 잠재력"
 donald_trump.13.d: "최근, 도널드 트럼프는 나사와 민간 우주 회사인 스페이스X가 꽤 큰 소행성을 지구 궤도로 가져와 채굴하도록 허락했습니다. 우리의 조언자들은 희귀한 재료들이 우리나라로 바로 배달될 수 있기 때문에 이 새로운 공간에 투자할 것을 추천하고 있습니다. 그러나 일부 사람들은 미국이 사업을 시작하기 위해 지불해야 했던 막대한 비용을 언급하며 우주로 확장하는 것을 반대합니다. 이 투자에 대한 수익률은 상황에 따라 다르지만, 수지를 맞추기 위해서는 25년이 걸릴 수도 있습니다. 더 많은 실질적인 투자는 이것을 줄일 수 있지만, 우리는 꽤 오랫동안 미국을 뒤쳐지게 할 것입니다.\n\n소행성 채굴과 관련하여 우리는 무엇을 해야 할까요? 국가적인 프로그램을 시작할까요, 아니면 아예 무시해 버릴까요?"

Not only this, but the power generated from this fusion is near the amount used to do the reaction in the first place. This means that, with some improvements, this could result in successful fusion power! Not only does this allow immense benefits at home, along with knowledge we may be able to use in using other materials for fusion, we can use this on the Moon, allowing a permanent outpost rather than mobile outposts!\n\nAll of this is far ahead of schedule, which is a surpise, and many at NASA have been left unprepared to implement this into the current Moonbase.

NASA는 이미 신속하게 대응하여 새 모듈을 즉각 제작하도록 명령하고 모든 현재 모듈을 면밀히 검사했습니다(현재로서는 달에서 모듈을 \"회수\"할 수 없기 때문에).\n\n모든 안전 문제가 해결될 때까지 프로젝트 진행을 중단하라는 국내 압력이 가중되면서 달기지 프로그램의 지속이 의문시되었습니다. 정치적 반발에 더해 긴급 자금이 절반으로 삭감되자 나사는 향후 우려 사항을 해결하기 위해 추가로 50억 달러를 요청하고 있습니다. 계속할지 여부를 결정하는 것은 당신의 선택입니다."

Produce our needs, we produce theirs as well. Remember, \"Its the economy, stupid.\""
 USA_teddys_legacy: "Teddy's Legacy"
 USA_teddys_legacy_desc: "Speak softly and carry a big stick. These were the ways of Teddy \"Rough Riding\" Roosevelt himself. A man of simple principles, he looked to better not only the homeland but the world itself. He used intimidation not as a way to solely seek power, but as a way of mediation from the gross negligence of human nature as we know it. Though his own hubris would cost him the ability to preemptively intervene in the Great War, ending a conflict so grand in scale that apparently we had to lead ourselves down the path of yet another one.

 USA_increasing_working_class_power_desc: "The majority of this nations' people believe they don't have a voice. This has caused an apathy crisis which previous administrations have capitalized on to hold their power. Through awareness campaigns, grass roots movements and strategic national holidays we can give the people the time they need, the voice they want and of course the motivation they deserve. In a democracy, voting is force itself, the supreme authority which is exercised against the realities of human weakness in character and care for its fellow members."

 USA_private_ownership_act: "Private Ownership Act"
 USA_private_ownership_act_desc: "The oxymoron that is the Private Ownership Act is one which will change the economic precedent of the nation. Private ownership can be established but nevertheless it will be subject to federal standings, if said standings are ignored and willfully disregarded the SBC and other affiliated agencies can come in and change leadership and at worst clean house all together.

We must be a new Socialist society, one which focuses on the public, their needs and the ability to create a unity in belief and understanding of cause."
 USA_political_science_reforms: "Political Science Reforms"
 USA_political_science_reforms_desc: "The ideas of politics and ideology are so confused in this supposed \"post truth\" era we live in that we must set a real standard of rationality and reason. Our scientific community with help through state mandated funding will be used to create templates of approaching sensitive subjects. The conscept of an ideology for example, an ideology is a well rounded set of beliefs stretching from both economic and social backgrounds. With this we can tell that ideologies are not left or right, but rather subjective to the individuals combined beliefs. As such the old distinction of left and right, one which was originally used to determine ones standing on economics is completely defunct in this new age of cutural and societal change as a whole. Technology in itself is a big fault for the confusion and as such we must help to better research, understand and implement new discoveries as a whole."
 USA_department_of_state_security: "Department Of State Security"
 USA_department_of_state_security_desc: "The DoSS will be a joint federal oversight commission which will unite the different state security branches we have within the nation. These different branches all have their own goals and fight with each other over the importance of either domestic or foreign happenings. We must put an end to this factionalism and have a united policy in approaching both sides of this coin. Formost to defend the public we must focus on the domestic issues, but to strengthen our domestic approach is to understand foreign incursions against us. We must defend our society from those who wish to strip it limb by limb from us."
 USA_socialist_militarism: "Socialist Militarism"
 USA_socialist_militarism_desc: "The militarism of the nation has always been used for imperialist reasoning. Exploiting nations for their resources by using our military in either direct means like in iraq, or by indirect means through our extensive military base apparatus is what makes the world hate us. We must slowly decommission and retrain the modern soldier. One who understands the true values that they serve the public, the cause of Socialism, the cause of a just, fairer world.

 USA_appeasing_rising_commissars_desc: "The retooling and retraining of values of our armed services has unfortunately led to the reality that even faced the old order.

Its this same hubris which cost the Soviets to lose the Polish Soviet War of 1921.

 USA_weaking_global_economics: "Weakening Global Economics"
 USA_weaking_global_economics_desc: "Through the stylistic wording of protectionism we will actually be planning our decoupling from the global market. Protectionism gives people the notion they can still trade and exploit us, however we know better. Our Anarchist economics will ensure that domestic supply chains are met by domestic means. This will sure have some push pull effect overall economically speaking. But remember, slow and steady wins the race, and I think we've been moving slow enough."
 USA_the_communes_act: "The Communes Act"
 USA_the_communes_act_desc: "The Communes Act is legislation set forth to spread out and decentralize the urban centers. This will be a slow process, but the idea is to, in a way, slowly de-industrialize and return people to the vast lands which we have as a nation. These new communes can work in conjunction with already established townships and villages near their area. This will reduce the government oversight of needed services which weakens the hold the government has as well, while still stregthening the domestic defense ideal of the nation."

 USA_restructuring_debt_payments_desc: "With our national debt surpassing the realm of feasible comprehension we must show in force that we plan to pay our dues which are owed.

 USA_gun_regulations_mechanic_category: "Gun Violence Crisis"
 USA_gun_regulations_mechanic_category_desc: "America is suffering from a unique epidemic that no other country is. Its cause stems from the Second Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America - The Right to Bear Arms. Its clear intent and purpose has slowly degraded as time has passed, and as we enter the new millennium, it may be time to re-evaluate its usefulness. The number of mass shootings continues to rise year after year, and it is clear that some sort of action must be taken.\n\nThis mechanic covers the rising mass shooting events within the United States and the problems resulting from the federal government's neglect and inaction. There are several ways to assuage the issues from gun violence, which are unlocked based on your choice on the gun control debate. Mechanically, two new modifiers are concerned with the §YLikelihood of Mass Shooting Events§! and the §YPercentage of Casualties Amount§!. As it is written, the former handles the likelihood that generic mass shooting events fire or can outright prevent major mass shooting events from occurring. The latter, the §YPercentage of Casualties Amount§!, happens when a mass shooting occurs. It increases or decreases the number of casualties based on whether you regulate the number of firearms and the type of firearms available at large to the civilian populace.\n\n§YLikelihood of Events§!: [?USA_frequency_percentage_for_gun_violence|%2]\n§YPercentage of Casaulties Amount§!: [?USA_casualties_percentage_for_gun_violence|%2]"

These proposed federal laws include red flag laws, which help pinpoint people at a higher likelihood of committing gun violence and prevent them from owning firearms.

 USA_limitations_on_the_firearms_sold_federally_desc: "The Restriction of Assault Weapons Act is the latest in new gun control legislation. It rehashes the expired federal ban on Assault Weapons. It establishes the provisions as permanent bans to help minimize the firearms available to the general public that could be used in mass casualty events. It is a new precedent in American history severely limiting the number of firearms available to law-abiding citizens; however, this is needed to keep America safe and free from the abuses of firearms."

 USA_require_licensing_for_firearms_federally_desc: "Several states in the United States have already implemented licensing requirements within their state. Gun control activists are campaigning for a National Register of Firearm Owners to create a federal database of all registered firearm owners. The National Register houses information that includes training, licensing of the owner, and proper registration of firearms owned by the licensed individual. The register should keep registered owners on track with annual training checks, renewals, and more while providing the United States federal government revenue."

 USA_government_buyback_program_federally_desc: "Due to legislative changes and a lack of turnover from the private owners of firearms in the States, the federal government is offering a firearm buyback program. The program is intended to help remove firearms that are deemed no longer street legal and bring them under the care of law enforcement and other government bodies. The program's cost is high, but it should reduce the frequency of mass shooting events and the number of casualties."

 USA_arm_the_teachers_with_pistols_federally_desc: "To increase security at schools while not compromising the rights of the common folk, the federal government is considering sponsoring teachers, staff, working professionals, and otherwise to receive firearm and firearm training. The idea is that the training individual will be able to respond quickly to a threat while in an active shooter situation. Immediate effects from the policy change would see more deterrence from would-be domestic terrorists; however, arming more people could turn places such as schools into an old Western shootout."

 USA_more_police_in_schools_federally_desc: "The majority of police forces have historically been in charge of the states. It is uncommon for the federal government to interfere with police jurisdictions unless it directly compromises the federal government's interests. The recent rise in mass shootings is catching the eye of the federal government, and it is considering establishing the so-called Agency of Federal School Policing to assist in combatting the rise in mass shootings. The agency will work to post police officers in schools and other academic sites to increase security and thwart any would-be attacker."
 USA_school_based_militias_federally: "Conscript Localities Act"
 USA_school_based_militias_federally_desc: "Some gun activists advocate for introducing locally sourced militias to defend important locations and schools from would-be attackers. The theory cites the opening line of the Second Amendment. \"A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" The people will regulate their local militia in the hopes of securing important areas and defending the places should anyone come to attack the area."

It loosened a fair number of gun regulations, such as no longer requiring records of non-armor piercing ammo purchases and banning the civilian transfer or ownership of fully automatic weapons (machine guns).

The Limited Background Checks on Gun Owners Bill should address some of these concerns and allow us to move forward into a new tomorrow."
 USA_explanation_on_gun_violence_mechanic: "\nThe [USA.GetNamewithFlag] gains access to a mechanic called §YGun Violence Crisis§!. It covers the rising mass shooting events within the United States and the problems resulting from the federal government's neglect and inaction. There are several ways to assuage the issues from gun violence, which are unlocked based on your choice on the gun control debate. Mechanically, two new modifiers are concerned with the §YLikelihood of Mass Shooting Events§! and the §YPercentage of Casualties Amount§!. As it is written, the former handles the likelihood that generic mass shooting events fire or can outright prevent major mass shooting events from occurring. The latter, the §YPercentage of Casualties Amount§!, happens when a mass shooting occurs. It increases or decreases the number of casualties based on whether you regulate the number of firearms and the type of firearms available at large to the civilian populace."

While some say their views are right and others argue against saying no its their views which are right. The reality is there is no real or earnestly clear answer. The complexities of such a geographically and demographically diverse nation will always create pitfalls and horizons for many. The best one can hope is that the stauch \"my way\" based \"solutions\" end up helping more than they hurt. Despite the last administration's budget surplus many still see the ballooning spending rates in healthcare, the rising welfare spending and so on as a growing concern along with economic volatility creating uncertainty in the dollar's value itself. If congress can't get the deficit spending under control there may be turbulent times ahead. Alas only time and congress shall be able to tell that."
