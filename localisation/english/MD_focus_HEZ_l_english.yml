The Attacker is not yet identified to the US authorities. It has been said that the assassination took place in a confrence located in the United States which Rushdie was also present in it. \nSome news agencies claim that Iranian, or even Hezbollahi-backed forces actually were the reason of Rushdie's death. \nBut there is no strong evidence as if the killer was a member of any Shi'ite Militia group or not. Many muslim instituations and organisations, especially the Shi'a ones, have praised the killer and offered him rewards. And at the same time, many people accross the Islamic World are  also celebrating the death of the \"Modern\" satan. \nDecades ago, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the former leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, demanded the death of Rushdie because of his \"blasphemous\" actions and considered the death of Rushdie a duty of any Muslim. \nAnd now it seems, his demand is fulfilled."

At the same time, the Saudi government refrains from giving any specific statistics of casualties and material losses in Riyadh. \nDue to the increasing influence of Shiites in Yemen and also formation and mobolization of armed groups of Shi'ites in Yemen (known as Yemeni Houthis), it is possible that this attack was originally from these groups and Hezbollah was actually involved in this attack indirectly. \nAt a time when the possibility of a civil war in the Arabian Peninsula, espcially in the country of Yemen, is increasing at any moment, this important event can have a huge impact on the involvement of Saudi Arabia as well as the axis of resistance in the upcoming civil war."
