The personnel of the police and the SBU waited, there was no mass support of the locals. Quite a lot of people were really going to watch regular rallies, but there were very few people in the seized premises of the regional administration in Donetsk: they were city madmen, criminal and semi-criminal persons, pro-Russian activists, visiting Russian outcasts from the border regions. Of the entire cohort of leaders of the then DPR, only Alexander Khryakov and Andrey Purgin from the public organization Donetsk Republic, founded back in the mid-2000s, were relatively well-known. Almost everyone in Donetsk was firmly convinced that the home-grown separatists would rally for several days and disperse. However, the situation escalated sharply. Moreover, where they were not expected - in Slavyansk (population - 120 thousand at that time) in the north of the region, a detachment of armed people of 52 people entered. First of all, they seized the city police department almost without resistance. The attackers threw explosive packages at the building, then with the help of a car they tore off the bars from the windows and went inside."

 SOV_more_fair_taxation: "Fair Taxation"
 SOV_more_fair_taxation_desc: "The main problem with our system is the issue of taxation of the regions. Now all taxes are collected first to the regional centers and later to the federal one. As a result, the federal center distributes all the money and, of course, most of the money goes to the center or important regions, while everyone else remains poor. In order to prevent economic inequality and separatism, we must reform our system so that the regions can dispose of funds themselves, this will ensure equal development of the regions."

 SOV_russian_democracy: "Russian Social Democarcy"
 SOV_russian_democracy_desc: "Striving for justice and social reforms have always been the main passion of the inhabitants of Russia, the Russian man has always gravitated to the idea of social justice, equality and freedom. This is clearly seen in the 20th century, when the people spontaneously supported popular democratic movements and social changes. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian people did not lose this aspiration and always supported those who promised social reforms. Thus we found ourselves in power, and we are obliged to realize the aspirations of our people."

 SOV_empower_legislature_desc: "The Russian Constituent Assembly was the first truly popular assembly that was to determine the future of the country and its people and had it not been for the Bolsheviks, the Constituent Assembly could have been a true people's parliament. The goal of becoming such a people's assembly was the creation of the State Duma as the lower house of the Federal Assembly. However, during the entire existence of the State Duma, it completely discredited itself and lost that unifying symbol of the people's will and unification. The time has come to restore confidence in the Duma by vesting it with real powers and ensuring real popular representation."

 SOV_defend_people_desc: "It hurts us to see a single mother collecting the last change for her child's medicine. It pains us to see a large family taking out a loan at an incredibly high interest rate to afford a one-room apartment. It pains us to see poverty spreading region by region. Thousands of citizens are left on the brink of poverty while banks and companies only get richer. To defeat this injustice, we must first create a system of benefits and social guarantees that can protect citizens from living in poverty."
 SOV_social_gurantees: "Social Gurantees and Healthcare"

There is a group that believes that the social reforms carried out are not radical enough, they position the party and themselves not as a moderately reformist, but radical organization which goal is to transform the current social order.

They believed that the main engine of the revolution should be the peasants, on their shoulders a real first democratic and later socialist society should be built. Although A Just Russia did not claim to be the heirs of the SRs, the transformations we carried out launched a process of peaceful but still radical transformation of society, even revolutionary in some respects.

 SOV_land_socialisation: "The Land Socialisation"
 SOV_land_socialisation_desc: "The main point of the program of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party was the socialization of land. According to the program, the land should belong to all the people of Russia and everyone has the right to use it. In fact, this means the transfer of land into state hands.

 SOV_third_way: "The Third Way"
 SOV_third_way_desc: "One of the characteristics of a democratic regime is the need for constant negotiation and balance. Many social democratic regimes have long gone from traditionally leftist ideas to more market-oriented but efficient ones. Such economic changes have been called the Third Way. Such economic ideas are characterized by a combination of traditionally market-oriented economic practices and social democratic ideas, creating a symbiosis of left-right practices to balance all. These are exactly the kind of ideas that are relevant and effective for us."

The peoples of the Volga region, Siberia, and the Caucasus are all part of the Russian nation, they are bearers of Russian identity, speak the Russian language, and share similar cultural traditions and values. It is this nation that should be dominant in Russia, only they should have priority for the state, because it is their interests that it represents. And not a single foreigner dare to claim their special rights, Russia is a country only for the multinational Russian people!"

 SOV_talks_with_rodina_desc: "We share a long history of relations with the Rodina Party. In the early 2000s, we were a single party, but as a result of internal contradictions, first the Duma faction broke up, and then a number of organizations left Rodina, which later formed Just Russia. Now the contradictions have subsided, and our political programs are virtually indistinguishable from each other, so the logical step would be to establish relations and unite to effectively implement our policies."

Their activities have not brought any benefit to society, all the money goes only to them without giving anything in return.

Ivan the Terrible, Alexander the Third, Joseph Stalin - these are all great leaders around whom the system of state power was built. Also, these are exactly the historical figures for whom the Russian people have the greatest respect. Now both people and the state system need the figure of a strong leader around whom people are ready to rally to achieve a great goal and we are ready to give it to them!"
