While the Reform Movement once waged an underground insurgency against the Saudi government as the Organization for Islamic Revolution in the Arabian Peninsula, in the 90s it moderated its rhetoric, broke off ties with Iran and agreed to dissolve itself in order to reach an accord with King Fahd, who agreed to release its members. Today the former members of the movement support moderate reform over Iranian-inspired revolution, a strategy that has allowed the Saudi monarchy to tolerate their continued activity but which has alienated the more radically-minded Shia youth."

Ethnic rebellions, most significantly by the Karen, and an occupation of Burmese territory by Chinese Nationalist troops fleeing the civil war, presented challenges to post-independence Burma that the military used to extend its political importance and eventually take over the government. In recent decades, however, the pro-democracy movement has weakened the Tatmadaw's political position and forced it to consider new options."

The party won five seats in the general election of 1994, which was called three years early because of political instability. Following Kamikamica's death from cancer in 1996, Ratu Finau Mara (the son of then-President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara) took over the leadership. In 1998, he was replaced by Adi Kuini Speed, the widow of former Fiji Labour Party (FLP) Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra, who had been deposed in a coup led by Rabuka, then a lieutenant colonel in the army, in 1987.

In industrial disputes, the government sided with the employers. In November 1984, when the Government announced a wage freeze, instead of calling a national strike, the largest trade union in Fiji, the Fiji Public Service Association (FPSA), decided, in March 1985 by a margin of 2914 votes to 326 votes, to \"associate itself with any organisation, in pursuance of workers' rights.\" The Fiji Labour Party was launched on 6 July 1985 under the auspices of the Fiji Trades Union Congress, at the Fiji Teachers Association hall in Suva."

The royal family still has some support in Libya, and the members of the family actively campaign against Gaddafi's rule"
