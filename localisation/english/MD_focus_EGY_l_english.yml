 egypt.100.d: "에버 기븐 (Ever Given) 이라 알려진 거대한 컨테이너 선박이 수에즈 운하에 좌초됐습니다! 400m 길이의 선박은 아침 시간의 강풍에 의해 불행한 사고를 일으켰습니다. 선박이 통행할 수 있는 수로가 하나 뿐인 부분에서 통행 장애가 발생하였습니다. 세계에서 가장 분주한 무역로 중 하나이기 때문에 장시간의 통행 장애는 유럽과 아시아 사이의 무역에 끔찍한 타격을 줄 겁니다."

This has caused a total blockade with ships on both sides pilling up nearby both entries. The Suez Canal Authorities responsible for maintaining the passage have been scrambling all available tugboats and plan to start digging momentarily.\n\n[EGY.GetLeader]'s government has announced it will do anything to clear the canal."
