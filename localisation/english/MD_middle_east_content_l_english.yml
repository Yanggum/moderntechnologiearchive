 israeli_settlements_desc: "Shortly after the Israeli victory in the Six Day War of 1967 that saw Israel seize control of the West Bank from Jordan, a group of Zionist activists staying in a hotel in Hebron refused to leave. The Israeli government sought to compromise with the activists by establishing the first Jewish settlement in the West Bank, in doing so preventing Palestinian herders from continuing to use that land. That event began a trend that has continued to this day, with over a hundred settlements being established, to the growing chagrin of the Palestinian population."

After the creation of Israel, Palestinian groups and even individuals have launched attacks against Israeli interests, a phenomenon that has persisted despite the signing of the Oslo Accords. This has been due to widespread Palestinian dissatisfaction about the continuing construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Israel's refusal to share control of Jerusalem among other grievances. These attacks have contributed to a sense of Israeli insecurity and support for hardline political forces."

This event saw a mass exodus of the Palestinian population from Israeli-controlled territory, leading to the establishment of large refugee camps in neighboring Arab countries. These refugees live a precarious existence, as many governments have not granted citizenship to Palestinian refugees, thereby often denying them of the right to work and access public services. These refugees yearn to return to the homes that their families owned prior to 1948, producing a difficult issue to resolve given the fact that much of the land formerly owned by these refugees is now inhabited by Israelis."

 peace_plan.2.d: "The 1948 Arab-Israeli War resulted in what Palestinians call al-Nakba, the catastrophe. This event saw a mass exodus of the Palestinian population from Israeli-controlled territory, leading to the establishment of large refugee camps in neighboring Arab countries. These refugees live a precarious existence, as many governments have not granted citizenship to Palestinian refugees, thereby often denying them of the right to work and access public services. These refugees yearn to return to the homes that their families owned prior to 1948, producing a difficult issue to resolve given the fact that much of the land formerly owned by these refugees is now inhabited by Israelis.\n\nShould we choose to uphold the Palestinian right of return, Israel will be forced to accept the return of potentially millions of refugees into Israeli-administered territory. If we choose not to, we can instead propose financial compensation and support for either the integration of Palestinian refugees into Arab host states or settling them in the West Bank."

That event began a trend that has continued to this day, with over a hundred settlements being established, to the growing chagrin of the Palestinian population.\n\nOne possible solution that has been proposed has been the extension of Israeli territory to include land with settlements, in exchange for the Israelis giving up some territory to the Palestinians. The exact proportion of land to be exchanged, however, remains up for debate."

It would be advisable for us to take action to reduce this pressure and salvage the kingdom's intenational reputation."
 saudi_royal.5.a: "Punish the Crown Prince."

In the days following the incident it quickly became clear that the agents who murdered Khashoggi had close links to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the son of the Saudi king.\n\nIn response to mounting pressure on Saudi Arabia to bring those responsible to justice, King Salman has vocally condemned Prince Mohammed and stripped him of his status as crown prince and next in line to the throne. The Saudi King assured the international community that the political career of the former rising star has come to an end, and that he will soon face Saudi courts as an ordinary citizen. World leaders and human rights organizations have welcomed the announcement, but many have also vowed watch carefully to ensure justice has truly been served."

In the days following the incident it quickly became clear that the agents who murdered Khashoggi had close links to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the son of the Saudi king.\n\nIn response to mounting pressure on Saudi Arabia to bring those responsible to justice, King Salman has ordered the arrest of several so-called \"rogue operatives\" who the Saudi government maintains were not ordered by the crown prince to assassinate Khashoggi. Several world leaders and human rights organizations have criticized the move, describing it as an attempt to absolve Prince Mohammed and the Saudi government of responsibility. In response to the lack of Saudi transparency, Germany and several other European nations have suspended all arms sales to the kingdom."
 saudi_royal.6.d3: "The world has reacted with shock and horror to the brutal murder of Saudi dissident and journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi operatives in Istanbul. In the days following the incident it quickly became clear that the agents who murdered Khashoggi had close links to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the son of the Saudi king.\n\nKing Salman and his son have refused to bow to international pressure to pursue those responsible, instead lambasting Jamal Khashoggi as a \"traitor\" who \"deserved death\". The shameless response of the Saudi government has drawn widespread condemnation, leading many states to withdraw their ambassadors in protest. The massive public pressure in Europe has forced most European states to suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia."

His unprecedented consolidation of power, marginalization of rivals and aggressive foreign policy have led some prominent princes to not so discreetly discuss the possibility of returning Mohammed bin Nayef to his original position. The crown prince wishes to arrest these dissenters and charge them with plotting a coup against the monarchy, thereby consolidating his own position even further. But perhaps the time has come to clip the young prince's wings."

 saudi_royal.8.t: "Saudi King Dismisses Son in Surprise Move"
 saudi_royal.8.d: "Many have noted the controversial rise of Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who, as crown prince, has pursued an aggressive approach to both domestic and international politics. His role in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi provoked widespread condemnation by civil society and some governments, and his reputation has been eroded by the lack of success of Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. Now his controversial acts have led to his downfall, as King Salman has reinstated Mohammed bin Nayef, Mohammed bin Salman's predecessor and rival, as crown prince and consigned his own son to political oblivion. The move has been attributed to pressure from within the royal family from figures such as Prince Ahmed bin Abdul Aziz, the young brother of King Salman and the only surviving member of the powerful so-called Sudairi Seven apart from the king himself. The young prince is rumored to have been placed under house arrest awaiting the decision of Prince Ahmed, Mohammed bin Nayef and their allies as to his final fate."

 saudi_royal.9.d: "Several government officials and senior members of the royal family have been detained in a sweeping crackdown that is being seen as the latest attempt by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to consolidate control over the country. Prominent figures that have been arrested include Mohammed bin Nayef, the widely respected former interior minister and predecessor of Mohammed bin Salman as crown prince, and Prince Ahmed bin Abdul Aziz, the King's younger brother.\n\nThe arrested princes have been accused of plotting to overthrow Mohammed bin Salman, who has alienated many within the royal family through his aggressive foreign policy and sidelining of rival royals. Some see this move as paving the way for the crown prince to take the throne, as the crackdown has helped eliminate two significant rivals who would have a powerful claim were the ailing King Salman to succumb to his poor health."

The young prince has spent years consolidating power within the royal family and recently managed to eliminate two of his most powerful rivals in a crackdown on alleged coup-plotters. Now, with the King Salman's poor health as the pretext, he has managed to secure the throne and will soon be crowned King Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques."

 arab_spring.14.d: "Following the marked escalation of protests in [FROM.GetNameDef], [FROM.GetLeader] has ordered military operations across the country to crack down on what he described as \"lawless rioters\" and \"terrorists\" who are backed by unnamed foreign powers. The clearing operations have seen outbreaks of violence between loyalist troops and armed protesters, who have acquired firearms from police armories and military defectors.\n\nIt is quickly becoming clear that what was once a non-violent protest movement is quickly descending first into insurgency, and then into civil war. In some parts of the country, it appears that opposition fighters have taken control of entire cities, but much of the information coming out of [FROM.GetNameDef] has become confused and convoluted. World leaders have called for restraint, while human rights organizations have criticized the brutality of [FROM.GetLeader]'s repression of protests."

Al-Nusra and its al-Qaeda backers have however disavowed ISIL, calling for it to be abolished.\n\nAnalysts are of the opinion that al-Qaeda and its Syrian branch, al-Nusra, have very different goals and methods from ISIL, while sharing a common ideology and opposition to the Syrian government. [ISI.GetLeader]'s organization has always sought to act independently of al-Qaeda, pursuing its own sectarian agenda that targets Muslim minority groups in a way that al-Qaeda has not done to the same extent. While its aspirations are transnational, al-Qaeda branches such as al-Nusra have normally confined their activities to target individual governments."

Nonetheless, the immediate danger to our government has been successfully averted."
