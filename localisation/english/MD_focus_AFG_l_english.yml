 TalibanInsurgency.14.t: "아프간의 상황"
 TalibanInsurgency.14.d: "We know that the Afghan government has allowed us to station troops in their territory but our military intelligence agency warns that the Taliban is currently waging an insurgency throughout every corner of Afghanistan and that there are a multitude of other terrorist groups taking advantage of the unstable situation in Afghanistan. The terror threat has reached a critical level that could pose a real danger to our troops stationed there.\n\nIf we continue to maintain our troops’ position in Afghanistan, they are likely to be targeted by the Taliban and other terrorist groups active in the nation. However, should we stay in the country, we can choose to assist the Afghan government forces in their counter-insurgency operations. If we choose to do so, our military can gain valuable experience such as different counter-insurgency and counter guerrilla warfare techniques, and can protect our citizens in Afghanistan.\n\n[ROOT.GetLeader], if you choose to continue stationing troops in Afghanistan, we won't stop you, but please think carefully if it is really worth the risk."

 TalibanInsurgency.17.d: "Thanks to our brave commando units, the Taliban hideout we found was destroyed, some of the Taliban militants attempted to resist but were killed by our commando units while most others surrendered with very few escaping justice. Overall, the operation was a complete success!"
 TalibanInsurgency.17.a: "훌륭하다!"
 TalibanInsurgency.18.t: "습격 실패"
 TalibanInsurgency.18.d: "Failing to carry out the raid conclusively was a huge blow to our counter-terror commando unit. The Taliban appeared to know our raid plans in advance and launched a preemptive attack on some of our convoys, planting IEDs on our must-go route and ambushing our commandos after the explosion occurred. Several commandos sadly died as a result.\n\nIn debriefing, some military generals suspect that there may have been sympathisers within the organisers of the operation who could have leaked the plan to the Taliban, the debriefing report also criticised corruption from the government that may have led to the loss of the commandos' lives. We must review this failure and learn a lesson from this!"

 TalibanInsurgency.21.d: "Our drone strike on the Taliban was successful! Our drone was able to spot, strike and destroy several Taliban hideouts near an urban zone, crippling their military capabilities in the area and temporarily leaving their local leadership structure completely disorganised.\n\nAlthough scared of the drone strike at first, the local population have now celebrated the retreat of the Taliban insurgents, at least for now."

 TalibanInsurgency.22.t: "실패한 드론 공습으로 인한 민간인 사상자 발생"
 TalibanInsurgency.22.d: "Today, one of our drones targeted and destroyed what appeared to be a Taliban hideout near a residential area, but recent intelligence reports concluded that the targeted building was in fact a small apartment building occupied by civilians.\n\nMedia reporters are already covering the incident and many groups are criticising our involvement in this war."
 TalibanInsurgency.22.a: "기술적인 결함일 뿐이다!"
 TalibanInsurgency.23.t: "폭격 작전 성공"
 TalibanInsurgency.23.d: "Intelligence reports that today one of our strategic bombers destroyed a Taliban tunnel complex hidden in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan.\n\nOur successful bombing campaign is starting to paralyse Taliban operations in the isolated areas of the country and the collapse of their infrastructure will force the Taliban to surrender in time."

 TalibanInsurgency.24.d: "Today, a catastrophic incident occurred!\n\nOur air force bombed a mountainous area in eastern Afghanistan until we discovered that there was no Taliban encampments in the area, but in fact, a small village between the mountains. The village was absolutely destroyed as a result of our bombing run.\n\nThe credibility of our air campaign has been called into serious repute. Our politicians and military command are being accused of war crimes against the Afghan people."
 TalibanInsurgency.24.a: "끔찍하군!"
 TalibanInsurgency.25.t: "기술 장비를 제공하는 [FROM.GetNameDef]"
 TalibanInsurgency.25.d: "A message from the [FROM.GetAdjective] government to our leadership has stated that [FROM.GetNameDef] will provide us some counter-insurgency technical equipment including explosive detection devices that can be installed on highways or in door entrances, dogs trained specifically to detect hidden explosives as well as some other electronics to improve our military and police's effectiveness in dealing with the Taliban insurgency.\n\nThe equipment is expected to arrive within a month and will hopefully reduce the growth of the Taliban insurgency, at least for a short period of time."

 GULBUDDIN_HEKMATYAR_DESC: "Gulbuddin Hekmatyar is an Afghan politician and former mujahideen leader. He is the founder and leader of the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin political party, so called after Mohammad Yunus Khalis split from Hezb-e Islami in 1979 to found Hezb-i Islami Khalis. He served as Prime Minister twice during the 1990s. Hekmatyar joined the Muslim Youth organization as a student in the early 1970s, where he was known for his Islamic radicalism rejected by much of the organization.\n\nHe spent time in Pakistan before returning to Afghanistan when the Soviet–Afghan War began in 1979, at which time the CIA began funding his rapidly growing Hezb-e Islami organization through the Pakistani intelligence service, ISI, one of the largest of the Afghan mujahideen. He received more CIA funding than any other mujahideen leader during the Soviet-Afghan War.\n\nFollowing the ouster of Soviet-backed Afghan President Mohammad Najibullah in 1992, Hekmatyar declined to form part of the new government and, with other warlords, engaged in the Afghan civil war, leading to the death of around 50,000 civilians in Kabul alone. Hekmatyar was accused of bearing the most responsibility for the rocket attacks on the city. In the meantime, as part of the peace and power-sharing efforts led by Ahmad Shah Massoud, Hekmatyar became Prime Minister of Afghanistan from 1993 to 1994 and again briefly from 1996 to 1997."
 MOHAMMED_ZAHIR_SHAH_DESC: "Serving for 40 years, Zahir was the longest-serving ruler of Afghanistan since the foundation of the Durrani Empire in the 18th century. He expanded Afghanistan's diplomatic relations with many countries, including with both sides of the Cold War. In the 1950s, Zahir Shah began modernising the country, culminating in the creation of a new constitution and a constitutional monarchy system. Demonstrating nonpartisanship, his long reign was marked by peace in the country that was lost afterwards.\n\nIn 1973, while Zahir Shah was undergoing medical treatment in Italy, his regime was overthrown in a coup d'etat by his cousin and former prime minister, Mohammed Daoud Khan, who established a single-party republic, ending more than 225 years of continuous monarchical government.\n\nZahir Shah is the best suiting candidate to revive a monarchist Afghanistan and to prolong his family's claim to the throne."
