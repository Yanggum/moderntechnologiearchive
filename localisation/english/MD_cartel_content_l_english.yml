Our military itself has and political infrastructure has been completely compromised and there is not telling who can be trusted anymore. The chaos will soon reach a fever pitch and then, we will be in the midst of a new civil war."
 anti_cartel_propaganda_decision: "Anti-Cartel Propaganda"
 anti_cartel_propaganda_decision_desc: "There has always been a growing myth surrounding the cartels, that they are like the banditos of the rose-tinted past. Lovable rogues that may do bad things but that only do them for the good of their people. Like all myths, it is a fabrication. One that anyone living under the influence of the cartels knows to be false. By exposing the horrors inflicted by them upon their own, in a nation-wide media campaign, we can work towards dispelling this myth once and for all."
 police_investments_decision: "경찰력 투자"
 police_investments_decision_desc: "카르텔과 같은 범죄 조직에 대해 아무리 말해도, 그들은 잘 조직되고, 잘 자금이 지원되고, 잘 무장되어 있습니다. 그들은 경고 사격 몇 번으로 해산할 수 있는 양 떼와 같지 않습니다. 이 조직화된 적에 맞서, 우리의 경찰은 첫 번째 방어선입니다. 하지만 이 방어선은 종종 그들에게 가해질 수 있는 폭력에 제대로 준비되어 있지 않습니다. 경찰을 군사화하는 데에는 단점이 있지만, 더 나은 장비, 전술, 인력만이 그들이 우리가 필요로 하는 방패가 될 수 있도록 해줄 것입니다. 그리고 그 모든 것에 돈이 필요합니다."
 utilize_the_military_decisions: "Utilize the Military"
 utilize_the_military_decisions_desc: "Even if our police become as well-armed as their military counterparts, their manpower pool and organization structure will always be limited by local resources and bureaucracy. By deploying our military directly, we gain the assistance of an even more well-armed asset with a more comprehensive command structure and a much wider manpower pool while avoiding local bureaucracy and existing local corruption. However, deploying the military is not popular with the citizens they may eschew the rights of, the police departments they may overreach, and the bureaucrats whose precious infrastructure they may damage. Essentially, what we gain in firepower we lose in public good will."
 target_cartel_money_laundering_decision: "Target Money Laundering Operations"
 target_cartel_money_laundering_decision_desc: "In order to make their ill-gotten money usable to purchase legitimate assets, cartels engage in the practice of money laundering, where cash is put into the financial system, distanced from the source through shifting it around, and then integrated into the launder's legal assets which can be used to legally acquire products or to buy out politicians and other government workers. In order to stem the tide of corruption and to cripple their legal infrastructure, we can attack the second and third steps in the money laundering process. This involves investigating, and shutting down, the banks and business that accept the money and shuffle it around. However, any failures here can compound back on us as the cartels are more likely to become hostile as we attack their cashflow."
 investigate_the_casinos: "카지노 수사"
 investigate_the_casinos_desc: "카지노는 종종 법과 규정을 어기려고 시도하는 준법 사업으로 운영되기 때문에 금융 시스템에 들어오는 돈의 첫 번째 중단점이 되는 경우가 많습니다. 카지노에 유입되는 돈은 거의 의심받지 않고 익명 또는 무해해 보이게 할 수 있기 때문입니다. 우리는 알려진 카르텔 멤버들이 자주 찾는 카지노를 파악하고 그들의 현금 흐름을 더러운 돈을 조사하기 시작할 수 있습니다. 더러운 돈이 발견되고 그들과 카르텔 사이에 연결이 생기면 우리는 사업을 폐쇄하고 그 과정에서 자산을 압수할 수 있습니다."
 investigates_the_banks: "은행 수사"
 investigates_the_banks_desc: "은행은 더 자주 합법적이지만, 모든 자금 세탁 운영에 필요한 중단점입니다. 핵심 은행 관계자와 자금 처리인을 조사하고 재무 기록을 살펴보면 거래가 발생하기 전에 또는 최종화되기 전에 잡을 수 있습니다. 이렇게 시간을 들여서 가장 큰 거래를 목표로 삼을 수 있습니다. 돈이 최종 목적지에 가까워질 때입니다. 이렇게 하면 이러한 엔티티에 가장 큰 고통을 주고 가능한 한 가장 많은 돈을 그들의 생태계에서 제거할 수 있습니다. 그러나 모니터링은 유지하기가 어렵습니다. 회사와 전술이 우리의 간섭에 적응하기 때문입니다. 또한 은행을 폐쇄하는 것은 정치적으로 불가능합니다."
 investigate_shell_companies: "페이퍼 컴퍼니 수사"
 investigate_shell_companies_desc: "자금 세탁 계획에서 중간과 최종 단계는 종종 쉘 회사가 관련하여 법적 자산과 돈을 유지하면서 이러한 자산을 최종 목적지로 가끔씩 이동시키는 것입니다. 이들은 범죄 조직과의 연결을 입증하기가 더 어려우므로 대상화하기가 더 어렵습니다. 하지만 그들은 조직의 작동에 극적인 영향을 미칠 수 있습니다. 이러한 압류는 돈으로 표출되는 경우가 드뭅니다. 왜냐하면 이체는 자주 작은 금액으로 이루어지지만 일정한 비율로 이루어지기 때문입니다. 대신 부동산, 차량 또는 합법적으로 구입한 무기와 같은 유형의 유동 자산으로 나타납니다."
 target_cartel_drug_running_decision: "Target Drug Running Operations"
 target_cartel_drug_running_decision_desc: "가장 큰 불법적인 수입원인 마약 밀매는 카르텔의 주요 활동입니다. 일부 카르텔은 마약을 직접 재배하지만, 많은 카르텔은 정제된 또는 정제되지 않은 마약을 공급망에 밀어넣어 돈을 벌고 있습니다. 마약이 이동하는 경로를 직접 표적화하고 모니터링함으로써 시작점, 종점, 중간 지점을 모두 파악할 수 있습니다. 이렇게 하면 장비 창고, 정제소, 농장, 마약 집, 기지 등 공격할 수 있는 길이 열립니다. 또는, 이동 중인 마약을 공격할 수도 있습니다. 대규모 작전에서는 일반적으로 비효율적이지만, 자원이 적어 손실을 만회할 수 있는 소규모 그룹을 크게 방해할 수 있습니다."
 raid_drug_convoys_decision: "마약 운반선 기습"
 raid_drug_convoys_decision_desc: "마약 운반선들을 도중에 습격하여 우리 자체에는 거의 비용이 들지 않고 네트워크에서 빠르게 마약을 제거할 수 있습니다. 그러나 대형 카르텔은 일반적으로 이러한 종류의 습격에 영향을 받지 않으며, 우리의 모니터링 시스템을 빠르게 피해 맞추게 됩니다. 작은 카르텔의 경우 이러한 공격으로 인해 중요한 현금 유입이 차단되며, 여기에 따른 여파로 서로를 공격하기도 합니다."
 raid_cartel_hideouts_decision: "카르텔 아지트 기습"
 raid_cartel_hideouts_decision_desc: "By raiding cartel strong points and supply depots, we can hamper their ability to move drugs, organize, and resist incursions into their territory. This usually manifests in the seizure of vehicles and weapons which could have been used against us or their enemies. This can have the added benefit, or downside, of cartels engaging in wars against their weakened rivals."
 raid_distribution_centres_decision: "물류 센터 기습"
 raid_distribution_centres_decision_desc: "By raiding cartel distribution centres, such as drug houses as stockpiles, we can remove a large quantity of drugs from the market. This also has the added benefit of hampering the future distribution of drugs through the seizure of large sums of dirty money and the arrests of drug dealers. However, this kind of raid has a high likelihood of a retaliatory strike as it does not inhibit the cartel's ability to enact violence."
 raid_refinement_centres_decision: "Raid Refinement Centres"
 raid_refinement_centres_decision_desc: "By raiding drug labs, plantations, or grow houses, we can inhibit the cartel's ability to create new drugs for distribution while setting them back immensely. This setback is typically enough to hamper their production for months as they attempt to recoup losses. At the same time, it is unlikely to incur a retaliatory strike as most of the cartel's resources are funneled into securing their territory."
 target_local_cartel_leaders_decision: "Target Local Cartel Leaders"
 target_local_cartel_leaders_decision_desc: "Like any organization, cartels require a leadership structure in order to maintain their operations. In arresting, or ensuring the disappearance, of local cartel leaders we can seriously damage that leadership structure. This means less recruits, less operations, and infighting over who should take up the vacant positions. These arrests and deaths have the added benefit of making exceptionally popular news when one of these villains finally gets what they deserve."

While the chance remains that it is is a numerical error it is more likely that the equipment has been fenced or is in the process of being fenced.

Our window of opportunity in taking back control of the stream of information is slipping away. If we do nothing, fear will take a deeper hold on our people and they will more easily be walked over by the monsters that did this."

 cartel_event.20.t: "Foreign Celebrity Murdered"
 cartel_event.20.d: "Over the last week, a celebrity from the country of [?var:foreign_celeb_country.GetName] was murdered by a local man. A cursory investigation into the murderer has revealed ties with one of our nation's largest criminal organizations. Already, we are facing outside pressure to take responsibility for the killing in some manner. A few proposals have been pushed forward but the least obtrusive one has been to endorse one of the celebrity's charities."
 cartel_event.20.a: "Endorse the charity."
 cartel_event.20.b: "They shouldn't have associated with criminals."
 cartel_event.21.t: "Cartels Import Exotic Animals"
 cartel_event.21.d: "A fascination with exotic animals has spread among the highest ranking members of our nation's cartels. Usually obtained illegally, these animals are used as signs of power and of office while occasionally being tied to gruesome killings. By tightening our grip on the influx of animals, we could expose the ridiculousness of those engaged in it by forcing an artificial increase in price. While a tiger may be intimidating, spending ten millions dollars on it is an obvious sign of opulence."
 cartel_event.21.a: "Stamp out the trade."
 cartel_event.21.b: "Ignore the trade."
 cartel_event.22.t: "Local Gang Clashes"
 cartel_event.22.d: "A gang war has erupted on the streets of one of our larger cities, hampering the local economy, claiming lives, and making residents afraid to leave their homes. While our analysts predict the violence will not last for long, the public is unlikely be comfortable with the idea of simply waiting out wanton killings. An intervention by our police forces could end the crisis early but would result in large overhead and possible loss of life."
 cartel_event.22.a: "Send in the police."
 cartel_event.22.b: "We are already stretched too thin."
 cartel_event.23.t: "USA Demands Extradition"
 cartel_event.23.d: "The United States of America has demanded the extradition of a drug lord that we have recently managed to put behind bars. In keeping on their good side with the prospects of future assistance against other drug lords, it would be advantageous for us to accept. However, American meddling in our legal system is bound to reduce our own self-reliance."
 cartel_event.23.a: "They can have him."
 cartel_event.23.b: "We can handle our own criminals."
 cartel_event.24.t: "Informant Lands Movie Deal"
 cartel_event.24.d: "One of our informants, a former member of our nation's largest criminal organizations, has been approached by a movie producer who heard about their life through word of mouth and wants to make the stories into a movie. Our informant is enthusiastic to accept but doing so could put his life at risk. We can choose to support the deal and allow the production of the movie or to put an end to any hopes of it within the near future."
 cartel_event.24.a: "Allow the movie deal."
 cartel_event.24.b: "It is too dangerous."
 cartel_event.25.t: "Informant Publishes Memoirs"
 cartel_event.25.d: "It appears as though the recent contact our informant had with a film producer has encouraged him to get his story out there. Over the past weeks, he's worked with several writers and government officials to produce a set of memoirs which can be published anonymously. According to everyone involved, the memoirs are actually very gripping and show the real, gruesome reality of life in the cartels."
 cartel_event.25.a: "I wonder if it will become a bestseller."
 cartel_event.26.t: "Informant Murdered on Set"
 cartel_event.26.d: "The body of our informant was discovered onset after a visit to oversee an important scene. Based on the state of the body, it has been concluded that the killing was done in retaliation by cartel members. Rightfully fearing for their lives, the production team behind the movie has decided to shudder production."
 cartel_event.26.a: "That's a shame."
 cartel_event.27.t: "Film Encourages Criminal Activity"
 cartel_event.27.d: "In what appears to have been the result of crossed wires, the new film about our informant's life is seen more like a De Vaqueros film than a gritty crime tragedy. This has led to an uptick in recruitment among many of our nation's criminal organizations as young men hope to emulate the film's caricatures."
 cartel_event.27.a: "Unfortunaté."
 cartel_event.28.t: "Film Discourages Criminal Activity"
 cartel_event.28.d: "The film that our informant has helped in the production of has reached critical acclaim within the first week of its release. What's more, the realistic depiction of the horrors of the cartels have encouraged more backlash against them. It seems that our young people would now rather grow up to fight the cartels than grow up to join them."
 cartel_event.28.a: "Excellent."
 cartel_event.29.t: "Cartels Execute Border Crossing"
 cartel_event.29.d: "A cartel in one of our neighbouring nations has executed a large-scale border crossing which neither of our border control agencies moved to counter, placing the onus on the other. This has led to a movement within our political apparatus to demand the tightening of our neighbour's borders, as there's no way this has been all our fault."
 cartel_event.29.a: "Demand stricter border control from neighbour."
 cartel_event.29.b: "It could damage our relations to make demands."
 cartel_event.30.t: "Neighbour Demands Border Control"
 cartel_event.30.d: "After a recent cartel border crossing from our country into the nation of [FROM.GetName], our neighbour has demanded that we increase our border security. So far, this has led to many argument within our diplomatic office."
 cartel_event.30.a: "Fine, we'll increase our security."
 cartel_event.30.b: "Why don't they increase their border security?"
 cartel_event.31.t: "Neighbour Accedes to Demands"
 cartel_event.31.d: "Our neighbour, [FROM.GetName], has acceded to our demands of tightened border control. No doubt, our voting base will be very pleased with this victory."
 cartel_event.31.a: "Excellent."
 cartel_event.32.t: "Neighbour Ignores our Demands"
 cartel_event.32.d: "Our neighbour, [FROM.GetName], has ignored our demands of tightened border control. Already, we're being lambasted by the news over our political failure."
 cartel_event.32.a: "Unfortunaté."
 cartel_event.33.t: "Suspicious Transfers tied to Oligarch"
 cartel_event.33.d: "During one of our recent investigations, we uncovered suspicious, albeit not illegal, money transfers from a certain oligarch's fund within our nation. It would be easy to grease the political gears to implicate them in our recent investigation. However, such an overreach would no doubt anger both foreign and domestic oligarchs."
 cartel_event.33.a: "Seize their assets."
 cartel_event.33.b: "Leave them alone."
 cartel_event.34.t: "Cartel Tank Spotted"
 cartel_event.34.d: "During a recent and unsuccessful raid against a cartel target, a tank was spotted being employed by the cartels. Appearing to be a heavily modified Soviet T-34, the tank was even capable of firing its main cannon."
 cartel_event.34.a: "We should do something about that."
 cartel_event.35.t: "Cartel Tank Destroyed"
 cartel_event.35.d: "During a recent successful raid against a cartel target, our agents managed to locate and destroy the T-34 that was seen during one of our recent failures. The victory, especially since it was carried out without anti-tank weapons, has become highly publicized in the news."
 cartel_event.35.a: "Thank God and our brave men."
 cartel_event.36.t: "Cartel Tank Used in Strike"
 cartel_event.36.d: "In the aftermath of one of our recent raids, the cartels made a retaliatory strike against one of our police stations. They wrecked the building, using a recently sighted T-34 to break down the fence and fire indiscriminately into the building. This has led to a significant number of casualties while the incident has reached the national news."
 cartel_event.36.a: "We should do something about that."
 cartel_event.37.t: "Transportation Shell Company"
 cartel_event.37.d: "While evaluating the assets of one of the companies we seized recently, it was noticed that one had been registered with a large number of fomrer military 6x6 trucks. After a short search, the vehicles were located in a warehouse owned by the company. The vehicles are now commonly used on farms and in a variety of other industries but are also still used in some legacy roles within our military."
 cartel_event.37.a: "Press them into military service."
 cartel_event.37.b: "Resell the trucks to civilian companies."
 cartel_event.38.t: "Crime Lord Accidentally Arrested"
 cartel_event.38.d: "A recent series of arrests on what were believed to only be low-level cartel members turns out to have caught a major crime boss by accident. Although he initially hid his identity, he was recognized by a police officer who was familiar with the man. He is now demanding his release and offering to post a substantial bail."
 cartel_event.38.a: "Ah, yes, all part of the plan."
 cartel_event.38.b: "Sorry about that, sir."
 cartel_event.39.t: "Authorities Stumble on Drug Plantation"
 cartel_event.39.d: "During a routine patrol in our nations countryside, a local police force stumbled across what they believe to be a drug plantation. Following protocol, they've sent the news up the chain and are now awaiting reinforcements or advisement on what to do."
 cartel_event.39.a: "Burn the fields and destroy the equipment."
 cartel_event.39.b: "Seize any evidence or equipment."
 cartel_event.39.c: "Leave the plantation be."
 cartel_event.40.t: "Anonymous Tip Off"
 cartel_event.40.d: "We've received an anonymous tip about a vulnerable cartel outpost. If we act quickly, we could overrun the position. However, this could be a prank or a ploy by the cartels to move us out of position and ambush us."
 cartel_event.40.a: "Act on the tip, any opportunity is a real one!"
 cartel_event.40.b: "Ignore the tip, it's most likely a prank."
 cartel_event.41.t: "Local Business Cooperate with Cartels"
 cartel_event.41.d: "Several businesses in one of our outlying towns have been exposed as working with the cartels, at times even openly. Allowing this to continue sends a clear message to our people that we are either unwilling or unable to govern. But to the cartels, it sends a message that we respect their authority to do so."
 cartel_event.41.a: "Reprimand the owners for their actions."
 cartel_event.41.b: "Turn a blind eye to the activity."
 cartel_event.42.t: "Industrial Conglomerates Safehousing Contraband"
 cartel_event.42.d: "It has recently to us through a tip that many of our largest businesses have been allowing the cartels to use their warehouses to store contraband. While this may be a sign of blatant corruption, a chance exists that it was the result of blackmailing. In either case, some kind of response from us is necessary. Otherwise, the tipper is likely to go to the news."
 cartel_event.42.a: "Seizes the warehouses and fine the conglomerates!"
 cartel_event.42.b: "Seize the contraband and give businesses a slap on the wrist."
 cartel_event.42.c: "It's their warehouses, but now everyone knows."
 cartel_event.43.t: "Corrupt Officials"
 cartel_event.43.d: "We have recently received an anonymous tip which led to a short investigation into one of our local politician's campaign investments. The investigation revealed that most of the campaign funds had been sourced from individuals and companies tied to cartel activities. Many signs in the investigation also points towards an intricate web of appointees, investors, and political allies."
 cartel_event.43.a: "Remove as many as possible from office, we can't tolerate this."
 cartel_event.43.b: "Campaign investments from private citizens aren't our business."
 cartel_event.44.t: "Port Authority Finds Contraband"
 cartel_event.44.d: "In one of our major ports, our port authority uncovered a shipping container full of contraband during a routine search. In accordance with protocol, they've temporarily impounded the ship while passing the decisions of what to do with it up to us."

 cartel_event.44.b: "Seize the container, it's the only illegal thing here."
 cartel_event.44.c: "Let this slide, business is business."
 cartel_event.45.t: "Bankers Turning a Blind Eye"
 cartel_event.45.d: "We've received an anonymous tip that several high-ranking bankers have been turning a blind eye to cartel activity, and at times, even participating in it. If we don't do something with this information, the tipper is likely to leak it to the news."
 cartel_event.45.a: "Jail the bankers in question and launch an investigation."
 cartel_event.45.b: "It's out of our hands..."
 cartel_event.46.t: "Enticing Cartel's Bribes"
 cartel_event.46.d: "Several members of our political establishment have recently been approached with an intriguing proposition. We treat the cartels like any other interest group, giving them space to operate as they please, and they bankroll several important, upcoming elections. The more ideologically malleable of our members are looking to us for guidance."
 cartel_event.46.a: "Of course! We're happy to be working with such an important interest group."
 cartel_event.46.b: "Outrageous! They do not represent the people's best interests."
 cartel_event.47.t: "Deals with the Devils"
 cartel_event.47.d: "Several high-ranking members of our political establishment were recently invited to a meeting with the heads of one of our nation's largest cartels. During the meeting, the cartel heads made their intentions clear. They do not need to be our enemies, in fact, we could be political allies. They've already offered a substantial piece of the pie for our cooperation and promise more to come as our partnership continues."
 cartel_event.47.a: "Taxes are an important part of a state's ability to function."

 cartel_event.48.t: "Regulate the Drug Trade"

 cartel_event.48.a: "Negotiate strictly regulated state-cartel cooperation."
 cartel_event.48.b: "Negotiate loosely regulated state-cartel cooperation."
 cartel_event.48.c: "We don't negotiate with criminals."
 cartel_event.49.t: "Youth Losing Faith"
 cartel_event.49.d: "One of the most malleable subsets of our population are our youth, and the state of our nation with the cartels has begun to turn them against our political establishment. While surveys indicate many plan to leave once they are capable of doing so, those who plan on staying seem intent on voting against us in the next election. We attempt an outreach program to try to channel the most energiested among them into fixing their home country with us."
 cartel_event.49.a: "Extend our hand with an outreach program."
 cartel_event.49.b: "Let them wallow in their own self-pity, we don't need them."
 cartel_event.53.t: "Cartel Retaliatory Strike"
 cartel_event.53.d: "In the aftermath of one of our recent raids, the cartels made a retaliatory strike against one of our police stations. They managed to breach the perimiter and chase our officers out of town, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. This has led to a number of casualties while the incident has reached the national news."
 cartel_event.53.a: "Unfortunaté."
 cartel_event.54.t: "Failed Cartel Retaliatory Strike"
 cartel_event.54.d: "In the aftermath of one of our recent raids, the cartels made a retaliatory strike against one of our police stations. Our officers held out valiantly while taking only a few casualties. After a few hours, they received reinforcements and managed to scatter the cartels. The incident has become a rallying point against the cartels in the national news."
 cartel_event.54.a: "Excellent."
 cartel_event.55.t: "Cartels Shoot Down Helicopter"
 cartel_event.55.d: "During a recent raid, one of our police helicopters was shot down by the cartels. A review of the incident has revealed that a stray bullet struck the pilot in the neck, leading to the catastropic crash as the co-pilot failed to regain control in time. Losing such an important piece of equipment, not to mention its crew, is a shame."
 cartel_event.55.a: "Unfortunaté."
 cartel_event.56.t: "Cartel Execution Survivor"
 cartel_event.56.d: "Found by a good samaritan and rushed to the hospital, a man from one of the cartel-infested regions within our nation is now lying on what may soon prove to be his death bed. However, we are presented with the opportunity to help him. He needs to be moved to a hospital with better facilities, something that one of our nearby military helicopters could accomplish."
 cartel_event.56.a: "He will become our new El Fusilado!"
 cartel_event.56.b: "It is a shame our doctors could not save him..."
 cartel_event.50.t1: "Successful Casino Investigations"
 cartel_event.50.d1: "After weeks of planning and monitoring, our police forces moved into one of our nation's casinos, seizing millions of dollars in dirty money, collecting important physical evidence, and arresting key players in the cartel's money laundering scheme. Using the evidence collected, we've placed a freeze on all legitimate assets tied to the casino and its operators. With this blow, we've taken out an important piece of infrastructure and hampered their ability to accrue usable funds."
 cartel_event.50.t2: "Successful Bank Investigations"
 cartel_event.50.d2: "After weeks of waiting and monitoring of money transfers, today we froze the assets of half a dozen companies and individuals who were tied to a cartel money laundering operation. Warrants have been placed for arrests and multiple smaller investigations have been launched into suspicious transfers between some of the companies and low-level politicians and bureaucrats. While the cartels will inevitably recover, the loss of so much all at once will be a hard blow to their infrastructure."
 cartel_event.50.t3: "Successful Shell Company Investigations"
 cartel_event.50.d3: "After weeks of investigation, we have shut down several suspicious companies, seizing their assets in the process. While very little money has been collected, we have seized a large number of properties, civilian vehicles, and other goods. This should serve as a hard blow, not only to their money laundering operation, but to their ability to maintain all of their operations."
 cartel_event.50.t4: "Failed Casino Investigations"
 cartel_event.50.d4: "In spite of our best efforts, our analyists have been unable to draw a connection between the cartels and the casino upon which our investigation has fallen. What's worse, people have started asking questions about where the money used in the investigation has been going, leading to successful political attacks on our candidates by the opposition. To add further insult to injury, the cartels continue their operations unimpeded."
 cartel_event.50.t5: "Failed Bank Investigations"
 cartel_event.50.d5: "In spite of the weeks our agents have spent hunched over computers and monitoring bank transfers, we have come up with no clear opportunity to strike a blow against the cartels. What's worse, people have started asking questions about where the money used in the investigation has been going, leading to successful political attacks on our candidates by the opposition. To add further insult to injury, the cartels continue their operations unimpeded."
 cartel_event.50.t6: "Failed Shell Company Investigations"
 cartel_event.50.d6: "In spite of the time and money funnelled into our investigations, all we've uncovered are divorce-security funds and liability protection schemes. What's worse, in the process we have managed to step on the toes of just enough people to have our investigation exposed on the national news. Such an embaressment has more than likely damaged our future election prospects. To add further insult to injury, the cartels continue their operations unimpeded."
 cartel_event.50.a: "The Investigation Concluded"
 cartel_event.51.t1: "Successful Drug Convoy Raid"
 cartel_event.51.d1: "In a recent strike along a known drug route, we managed to seize hundreds of kilograms of drugs, arrest several low-level cartel members, and seize several civilian vehicles with few casualties. This should be enough to stop the trade for a short time but these losses can be easily absorbed by any sufficiently large cartel."
 cartel_event.51.t2: "Successful Cartel Hideout Raid"
 cartel_event.51.d2: "In a recent strike on a known cartel stronghold, we managed to kill or arrest dozens of cartel members while seizing or destroying several pieces of usable military hardware and improvised weapons. This blow could have a knock-on effect as other organizations seek to take advantage of the momentary weakness."
 cartel_event.51.t3: "Successful Distribution Centres Raid"
 cartel_event.51.d3: "In a recent strike on a known distribution centre, we managed to seize hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of dirty money and drugs. We've also begun rounding up numerous drug dealers tied to the location, seriously hampering their ability to push drugs onto the market and turn a profit. In spite of our success, we should be wary of the possibility of a reprisal attack."
 cartel_event.51.t4: "Successful Refinement Centres Raid"
 cartel_event.51.d4: "In a recent strike on a known refinement centre, we managed to destroy hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment and drugs. We've also managed to arrest many of the people involved in the refinement, which will put them at a disadvantage when producing more drugs in the future. In spite of our success, we should be wary of the possibility of a reprisal attack."
 cartel_event.51.t5: "Failed Drug Convoy Raid"
 cartel_event.51.d5: "In a recent attempted strike along a known drug route, our forces were overwhelmed and forced to retreat with several casualties being left behind. Information about the event has already leaked out into the public, reducing faith in our government. We should be wary of the possibility of a reprisal attack."
 cartel_event.51.t6: "Failed Cartel Hideout Raid"
 cartel_event.51.d6: "In a recent attempted strike on a known cartel stronghold, our forces were overwhelmed and forced to retreat with several casualties being left behind.

 cartel_event.51.t7: "Failed Distribution Centres Raid"
 cartel_event.51.d7: "In a recent attempted strike on a known cartel distribution centre, our forces were overwhelmed and forced to retreat with several casualties being left behind. Information about the event has already leaked out into the public, reducing faith in our government. Anyone related to the location has by this point scattered. We should be wary of the possibility of a reprisal attack."
 cartel_event.51.t8: "Failed Refinement Centres Raid"
 cartel_event.51.d8: "In a recent attempted strike on a known cartel refinement centre, our forces were overwhelmed and forced to retreat with several casualties being left behind.

 cartel_event.51.a: "The Raid Concluded"
 cartel_event.52.t: "The End of the Cartels"
 cartel_event.52.d: "After decades of strife and the sacrifice of many, we have excised any remnant of the cartels from our country. However, we are still not safe from their influence. Other countries in our region are still suffering the reign of these monsters and it now happens that we have ample expertise in monster hunting."
 cartel_event.52.a: "This is a new era for [ROOT.GetName]."
 cartel_event.100.t: "[FROM.GetName] Has Defeated their Cartels"
