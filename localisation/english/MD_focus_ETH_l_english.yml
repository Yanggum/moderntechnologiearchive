 ethiopia.1.d: "The Ethiopian government's attempts to get the national economy back on track through the invitation of international companies and the strengthening of local and regional economic sectors with the usage of government investments.\n\nNow, Ethiopia has approached our ministry of finance with a request to grant further government loans to the Ethiopian industrial and economic development sector. It seems as if we have little to gain for our government, but our businesspeople are warning us that if we don't grant loans to Ethiopia, somebody else will. And if our businesses are rejected due to our hostile stance towards the country, somebody else's companies are sure to get accepted."
 ethiopia.1.a: "We shall grant additional loans."

 ethiopia.5.t: "The African Alliance"
 ethiopia.5.d: "It was Ethiopia whose flag defined the colors of the Pan-African movement due to our prolonged resistance against European colonialism. It was Ethiopia shaping generations of young black Africans both inside and outside our borders to be strong and proud African nationalists. It was Ethiopia that followed the doctrine of unity in diversity across the African continent.\n\nBut unity and diversity are no longer enough. The European colonial powers of old are eyeing greedily at their former African possessions, aiming to once again carve out economic spheres of interest for their mega-corporations. Chinese investments from the far east are both a blessing and a curse, as China aims to establish itself as an equal to the great powers of old. The United States has long abandoned her doctrine of freedom and liberty in favor of a doctrine of oil and money.\n\nAfrica needs to stand together and unite under the flag of one common military alliance to resist both American and Russian, both Chinese and Indian ambitions to form military blocs.\n\nWe shall send invitations to all eligible African Union members. Except for Eritrea. We will conveniently forget Eritrea."
 ethiopia.5.a: "For Africa! For Humanity!"
 ethiopia.6.t: "Invitation to the African Alliance"
 ethiopia.6.d: "In daring defiance to European and East Asian diplomatic influence, the Ethiopian government aims to reform the African Union into a complete military bloc. We are eligible to join due to the fact that we are an African Union member not already entangled in another alliance.\n\nBut should we surrender our sovereignty and neutrality in favor of the African Alliance? Or is the African Alliance our key to sovereignty and neutrality in the first place?"
 ethiopia.6.a: "Africa stands as one!"
 ethiopia.6.b: "Oh, I don't think so."
 ethiopia.7.t: "Addis Ababa Light Rail finished"
 ethiopia.7.d: "The Addis Ababa Light Rail finally finished its construction phase and were now going on to the testing. The Light Rail was originally intended to have a total of 41 stations on its two lines (of which 39 were finished) and each train has a capacity to carry 286 passengers. This will enable the light rail transit to provide a transportation service to 15,000 passengers per hour per direction and 60,000 in all four directions while the fares cost 2-6 Ethiopian birr.\n\nThe railway was contracted by the China Railway Group Limited and it is operated by the Shenzhen Metro Group. Addis Ababa Light Rail currently has a fleet of 41 three-section 70% low-floor trams manufactured by CNR Changchun."
 ethiopia.7.a: "Finally no more traffic jam's!"
 ethiopia.8.t: "Ethio-Djibouti Railways stops its operations"
 ethiopia.8.d: "After World War II, the railway began a long period of decline. Traffic on the railway dropped in half from 1953 to 1957, as road transport began to compete for cargo. The Ogaden War of 1977–1978 dealt a further blow to the railway, as Somali troops invaded us and captured the railway as far as Dire Dawa. Portions of the railway were blown up in the war, and railway operations were again cut in half. After the war ended, the railway continued to decline from a lack of maintenance and attacks from rebels such as the Ogaden Liberation Front.\n\nBoth the lack of maintenance and an ambitious road construction program made rail transport increasingly non-competitive. In January 1985, the Awash rail disaster killed 429 passengers when their train derailed on the Awash River Bridge and fell into the gorge below. Railway service finally ended this year between Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa, but trains continued to run between Dire Dawa and Djibouti. The tracks between Dire Dawa and Addis Ababa fell into total disrepair, and many of the rails were stolen and sold for scrap."
 ethiopia.8.a: "We should have repaired it earlier"
 ethiopia.9.t: "Addis Ababa Light Rail expanded"
 ethiopia.9.d: "The new line built is completely grade-separated. Apart from extending the existing lines, two new lines were built. The first one start at St. George's Cathedral, pass along Mexico Square to the African Union Headquarters and terminate at Lebu, connecting to the new national rail network. The second line start at Megenagna Roundabout and passes via Bole Airport, Wello Sefer area, Saris market area and Jommo area and terminates at Lebu."
 ethiopia.9.a: "From Addis Ababa to Djibouti!"
 ethiopia.10.t: "Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway finished"
 ethiopia.10.d: "This will serve as our backbone of the new Ethiopian National Railway Network. It provides access to the sea, linking our capital of Addis Ababa with Djibouti and its Port of Doraleh."

 ethiopia.11.d: "For the second time since the second world war Eritrea find itself under Ethiopian occupation. Many high ranking politicians and military leaders gone into exile and refounded the Eritrean Liberation Front in nearby Sudan.\n\nAfter the independence of Eritrea the original EPLF reformed itself into the People's Front for Democracy and Justice and acted as the ruling party of Eritrea until we disbanded it.\n\nHowever since Isaya is currently under house arrest in Addis Ababa, his presidential adviser Yemane Gebreab took over and is currently the head of the political wing of the ELPF."
 ethiopia.11.a: "He better stays there"
 ethiopia.12.t: "Military convoy raided by ELPF"
 ethiopia.12.d: "In an surprising attack on one of our military convoys in the region of Eritrea, the entire convoy got wiped out and its load stolen. The Eritrean Liberation Front, which took responsibility for this ambush, got away before any reinforcements could arrive to the scene."
 ethiopia.12.a: "They will need more to stop us!"
 ethiopia.13.t: "Isayas Afewerki arrested"
 ethiopia.13.d: "As soon as Eritreas last stronghold fell we found Isaias Afwerki and his most loyal men while they tried to escape to neighboring Sudan. His bodyguards put up a good fight but the numbers wasn't on there side and so Isayas found itself soon on the way to Addis Ababa where he will await his trial.\n\nTill then he is put under house arrest."
 ethiopia.13.a: "Put him under house arrest"
 ethiopia.14.t: "Trial of Isaias Afwerki"
 ethiopia.14.d: "Today is the trial of former President of Eritrea, Isaias Afwerki. Under loud protest by himself he is brought into the court chamber and accuse the court of corruption and an unjustly trial under the point that his sentence is already decided. Many international reporters share this point but this wont save him today.\n\nAnyways, after 3500 Birr the judges agreed to our decision which will be...?"
 ethiopia.14.a: "Sentence him to death"
 ethiopia.14.b: "Life imprisonment should do it"
 ethiopia.15.t: "Trial of Isaias Afwerki"
 ethiopia.15.d: "Today was the trial of former President of Eritrea, Isaias Afwerki. The sitting was long, but at the end of the day the decision was made, Isaya gets imprisoned for life.\n\nThis sentence wasn't surprising to anyone and he will be transferred as soon as possible to a jail on the Eritrean side."
 ethiopia.15.a: "He deserve that"
 ethiopia.16.t: "Trial of Isaias Afwerki"
 ethiopia.16.d: "Today was the trial of former President of Eritrea, Isaias Afwerki. The sitting was long, but at the end of the day the decision was made, Isaya will face the death sentence.\n\nThis sentence wasn't made since 1998, when an Eritrean businessman gunned down an popular Ethiopian general and thus is quite special.\n\nAlmost immediately after the judgment was made, armed police officers escorted him out of the hall where he faced his sentence."
 ethiopia.16.a: "He was a bad guy"
 ethiopia.17.t: "Local police station attacked by ELPF"
 ethiopia.17.d: "In the middle of the day three trucks stopped in front of the police station and armed men opened instantly fire upon the poor officers in the building.\n\nNone of them survived and the weapon safe was plundered. The armed men escaped as soon as they were coming.\n\nLater that day the ELPF uploaded a video where they claim the responsibility for that attack."
 ethiopia.17.a: "Sooner or later we will find them"

 ethiopia.18.a: "We welcome him"
 ethiopia.19.t: "Zera Selassies Coronation"
 ethiopia.19.d: "The day was perfectly chosen, the sun is shining bright and there is not a single cloud in the sky. Zera Selassie rides on his horse, surrounded by a large, cheering crowd, towards the Medhane Alem Cathedral in Addis Ababa. Today is his official coronation as His Imperial Majesty Emperor Amha Selassie I, Elect of God, Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah and King of Kings of Ethiopia.\n\nTogether with his only child he holds on front of the cathedral, which got decorated with the imperial banners, and steps towards the entrance. Inside the cathedral is everyone from importance in Ethiopia awaiting in eager the coronation.\n\nAs Zera walks towards the Presbyter, his heart begin to beat faster.

 ethiopia.20.t: "Famine Strikes!"
 ethiopia.20.d: "The recent conflict between our neighbors and the refusal of cooperation between Eritrea and Ethiopia has resulted in something far more devastating. The country has fallen into a famine and people are beginning to die as the food market in the country is strangled by the lack of cooperation from our neighbors. The government must do something in order to help the people. They need to do something before the country collapses in on itself."

 ethiopia.21.t: "Defeat in the Field"
 ethiopia.21.d: "After months of gridlock, the enemy has finally broken through our lines and invaded our lands proper. Perhaps we should agree to the peace framework that the Organization of African Unity laid down in 1998 and suggest a ceasefire?"

 ethiopia.23.t: "Trials of The Eritrean Deputies"
 ethiopia.23.d: "Much like Afwerki, those who stand for Eritrean agitation must also be tried for their crimes against Ethiopia and its people, the question now is, should we sentence these deputies to death, or simply behind bars for life?"
 ethiopia.23.a: "Death It Is!"
 ethiopia.23.b: "Life Imprisonment Is Enough."
