 Burma_News.3.a: "It had to happen eventually."

 Burma_News.4.d: "Reports are beginning to emerge about attempts by the civilian government of Myanmar to undermine the political influence of the country's military, the Tatmadaw. While the military's material strength is undoubtedly superior, analysts predict that the civilian government will seek to undermine the military's popular support and pressure the military indirectly through supporting popular protest. How the Tatmadaw will react to these moves remains uncertain."

 Burma_News.5.t: "An End to Peace"
 Burma_News.5.d: "[BRM.GetLeader] today proclaimed that the government will no longer pursue ceasefires with the various rebel groups fighting the central government. This marks a significant shift in policy from the government's normal cycle of ceasefires and clashes with rebel groups."

 Burma_News.6.t: "The [BRM.GetName]"
 Burma_News.6.d: "The nation formerly known as the Union of Myanmar has officially become a Federation, marking a major shift in the government's attitude towards the ethnic minorities that dominate its border regions. The government had previously refused to grant any significant autonomy to these regions, including the Shan, Karen and Kachin states, but after years of conflict the government has finally accepted that this policy was not viable in the long term."
 Burma_News.6.a: "This was inevitable"
 Burma_News.7.t: "Myanmar cracks down on protests"
 Burma_News.7.d: "Information coming out of Myanmar has been scarce in recent weeks but it has become clear that the government has responded violently to peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations, launching a crackdown of monumental proportions. Western leaders and the United Nations Secretary-General have vocally denounced the violence in Myanmar. China and Russia have not publicly commented on the crackdown, but have vetoed a Security Council resolution condemning the violence."
 Burma_News.7.a: "How awful!"
 Burma_News.7.b: "It had to happen eventually"
 Burma_News.8.t: "The Insurgency has been Crushed"
 Burma_News.8.d: "Today [BRM.GetLeader] announced the last of Myanmar's ethnic rebellions has been wiped out. After decades of fighting, the government's adoption of a new strategy towards the insurgency, focusing on each remaining rebel group one at a time and refusing any possibility of compromise, has finally brought the conflict to a close. However, this achievement has come at a cost. Myanmar's relations with China have been perhaps irrevocably damaged by the military campaign. Hundreds of thousands of refugees have taken refuge within China's borders and dozens of Chinese citizens have been killed or injured by the fighting, not to mention China's chagrin at having its close ally, the United Wa State Army, shattered by the tatmadaw. Moreover, it remains to be seen whether the ethnic minorities now under military occupation will continue to accept the rule of the central government if all that is compelling them to do so is fear of the military's brutality."

 Insurgency.13.t: "The rebels are making reasonable demands"

 Insurgency.18.t: "The government has invited us to negotiations of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement"
 Insurgency.18.d: "The new government has announced an ambitious proposal to make peace with all of the major ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) in Myanmar. We are among one of the 15 largest groups that have been invited to the negotiations. If we attend these talks, we will have a seat at the table in what could be the negotiations that shape the future of Myanmar."
 Insurgency.18.a: "Let's see how this goes."
 Insurgency.18.b: "This is a waste of time."
 Insurgency.19.t: "The First Round of Negotiations"
 Insurgency.19.d: "One of the most significant issues regarding the conflict in Myanmar is whether the state of Myanmar should be a union or a federation. Historically, the Burmese government has refused to accept the possibility of Myanmar becoming a federation, as, painfully aware of the legacy of colonial divide-and-rule, it fears that such a move would lead to the disintegration of the country. The ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) on the other hand have insisted on the need for a more representative form of government. Going forward in these negotiations, we should establish what our negotiation position on this particular issue is."
 Insurgency.19.a: "We must preserve the Union."
 Insurgency.19.b: "Times are changing and so must we, we should become a Federation."
 Insurgency.19.c: "We should compromise on this point."
 Insurgency.20.t: "The Second Round of Negotiations"
 Insurgency.20.d: "The next issue on the agenda concerns the composition of the Tatmadaw. Many EAOs argue that the nation's armed forces cannot be overwhelmingly dominated by Buddhists and ethnic Burmans as it is at the moment. We must consider whether or not to address these concerns."
 Insurgency.20.a: "Keep to the status quo."
 Insurgency.20.b: "Commit ourselves to improving minority representation in the military."
 Insurgency.20.c: "This issue is too significant to decide right now."
 Insurgency.21.t: "The Final Round of Negotiations"
 Insurgency.21.d: "The biggest stumbling block that we have encountered in these negotiations is whether to pursue disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) or security sector reform (SSR). The Tatmadaw has historically preferred DDR due to its desire to completely disarm the EAOs or bring them under its own command. The EAOs however have preferred SSR, a framework which would allow them to be integrated into the country's security sector whilst keeping their arms and their autonomy. We should consider the best solution to this impasse."
 Insurgency.21.a: "They cannot keep their arms. We choose DDR."
 Insurgency.21.b: "We must make some sacrifices, and so will accept SSR."
 Insurgency.21.c: "This issue is too important to decide at this moment."
 Insurgency.22.t: "We are satisfied with this draft"
 Insurgency.22.d: "The government has made enough concessions for us to bring this signed draft back to our people and carry ourselves with pride."
 Insurgency.22.a: "We will sign."
 Insurgency.23.t: "This draft is not acceptable!"
 Insurgency.23.d: "The government and the military clearly have no desire to draft an agreement worth any more than the paper is printed on! If we were to take this back to our people they would surely skin us alive."
 Insurgency.23.a: "We will not sign!"
 Insurgency.24.t: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation has signed the NCA!"
 Insurgency.24.d: "Finding our negotiation position tolerable, the [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation has joined us in signing this historic document."
 Insurgency.24.a: "Wonderful!"
 Insurgency.25.t: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation has refused to sign the NCA!"
 Insurgency.25.d: "Citing our 'unreasonable' demands, the [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation has refused to join us in signing this historic document."
 Insurgency.25.a: "Their loss."
 Insurgency.26.t: "Shan rebels have attacked our financial interests!"
 Insurgency.26.d: "Clearly trying to curry favour with Thailand and other states, the Shan rebels have taken it upon themselves to undermine our drug-trafficking capabilities. We must decide on a suitable response to this aggression, with possibilities ranging from doing nothing at all to attacking some of their strongholds or even declaring all-out war."
 Insurgency.26.a: "This means war!"
 Insurgency.26.b: "Our response should be proportionate."
 Insurgency.26.c: "We cannot respond at this point in time."
 Insurgency.27.t: "The United Wa State Army has retaliated!"
 Insurgency.27.d: "In response to our attacks on their drug trafficking assets, the UWSA has launched attacks on some of our border outposts. While we managed to repel them, we have suffered some casualties."
 Insurgency.27.a: "Regrettable."

The balance between peace and war is a delicate one, and it is one that both sides must handle carefully.\n\nThe level of influence Myanmar has in any particular EAO determines whether Myanmar can annex the rebel territory or whether the breakaway state can declare independence.
